# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Repository

Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) repository! This project focuses on integrating retrieval mechanisms with language generation models to improve the relevance and accuracy of generated text. The RAG model dynamically retrieves documents relevant to a query and conditions its responses on both the query and the retrieved documents.

## Project Overview

RAG combines the power of transformer-based language models with a retrieval system (e.g., a document database) to enhance the generation of text. This method is particularly effective for tasks like question answering, where context and precision are critical.

## Features

- **Dynamic Document Retrieval:** Leverage a retrieval system to fetch relevant context in real-time.
- **Enhanced Language Generation:** Combine retrieved documents with advanced NLP models for precise and context-aware outputs.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Designed to handle large-scale data and query volumes efficiently.
