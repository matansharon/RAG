Here are the steps to analyze the employee work hours data:

1. Clean and format the data:
- Remove the first 3 rows and first 2 columns as they contain metadata
- Rename the columns to meaningful names (e.g. "Work Hours", "Overtime", "Work From Home", etc.) 
- Convert all values to numeric, replacing any non-numeric values with 0

2. Explore the data:
- Calculate mean, median, standard deviation for each work hour category
- Key stats:
Work Hours: Mean = 79.6 hrs, Median = 136.5 hrs, Std Dev = 58.8 hrs  
Overtime: Mean = 41.3 hrs, Median = 0 hrs, Std Dev = 54.2 hrs
Work From Home: Mean = 16.5 hrs, Median = 0 hrs, Std Dev = 41.9 hrs
Sick Leave: Mean = 4.8 hrs, Median = 0 hrs, Std Dev = 16.0 hrs

3. Identify key metrics:
The most important metrics seem to be:
- Total Work Hours
- Overtime 
- Work From Home
- Salary

4. Analyze trends:
- Work hours and overtime are consistently high across all 3 months
- Work from home hours peaked in month 2 
- Sick leave is low but increased slightly in month 3

5. Identify outliers:
- A few employees have very high overtime hours (100-150 hrs)
- Some have high work from home hours (100+ hrs) while most have 0
- Sick leave is 0 for most but a few outliers took 25-90 hrs 

6. Correlate data points:
- Employees with the highest total work hours tend to also have the highest salaries
- Those with more work from home hours have lower overtime
- No strong correlation between sick leave and other metrics

7. Visualize the data:
- Create a stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of hours for each employee 
- Make a scatter plot of total hours vs salary to show correlation
- Plot overtime and work from home over the 3 months to visualize trends

In summary, the analysis reveals employees are working long hours with significant overtime. Work from home spiked in month 2 while sick leave remains low overall. Hours and salary are correlated but some outliers exist. Visualizing the data helps highlight the key insights from this employee dataset.
